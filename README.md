# LendingCaseStudyAssignment

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a lending club company

### Analysis as follows:

#### Univariate Analysis
  o Loan Status Proportion
  o Employment history proportion of the customer base

#### Bivariate Analysis + Segmented Analysis
  o State-wise customer charged off pattern
  o Defaulters and Non-defaulters rate aggregated on grades and sub-grades level
  o Distribution of loan amount across grades and sub-grades
  o Distribution of loan amount across loan status
  o Distribution of interest rate across loan status

#### Multi-variate Analysis
  o Correlation between loan amount,annual income, DTI

### Recommendations
   Perform additional checks and validations for states with a less number of loans i.e. NE state to 
    ensure minimal defaulters.
    
   Increase the number of loans offered in the A to C grade categories, as these have a relatively lower 
    default rate.
    
   Address the issue of high interest rates, which contribute to increased defaults. Consider 
    implementing a reduction in interest rates after a specific duration for ongoing loan repayments.
    
   Loans with a 36-month term exhibit a lower default rate compared to 60-month terms. However, it is 
    surprising that there are no current loans in this category. The company should promote 36-month 
    loan terms and investigate the reasons behind the lack of ongoing loans in this segment.
  
   Prioritize aligning the principal loan amount with the borrower’s annual income and debt-to-income 
    ratio (DTI). For instance, approve higher loan amounts for customers with a DTI between 0 and 5, 
    moderate amounts for DTI between 5 and 15, and lower amounts for DTIs exceeding 15 up to 30.
